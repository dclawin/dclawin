# Data for Vintage Biddle Convectors

## Convectors

Convectors offer important advantages over traditional radiators. They are smaller in size and can easily be place underneath bib external windows.
Furthermore, they ensure an evenly distributed flow of warm air in the entire room which makes them well suited for rooms with high dealings.
Most important: They only contain a limited amount of water, about 1 l. This ensures fast heat up an efficient control, so they are especially suitable in combination with heat pump systems running at low water temperatures.

Unfortunately, for some convectors, no CAD planning data for is available for some older systems like Biddle converters, still on par with modern products. 

This data is intended to assist system calculations and avoid unnecessary replacements of radiators still running well.

## Datasheet

File datasheet_biddle_convectors.pdf contains a copy of the technical datasheet (German)

## BDH dataset for planning software

The datasheet was used to derive the "hk.dat" file provided. Linear interpolation was used to derive power data over convector length. Hence there is a small difference for power data between 1000W and 2000W. Radiator coefficient of 1.396 was derived form drawing on page 4 in the datasheet.

This file is based on best efforts and provided as help for system calculations like hydraulic balancing, as is.
